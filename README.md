# Voice-Controlled-Robot

This project implements a voice-controlled car using Arduino and L298N motor driver. The car can be controlled by voice commands, allowing for a hands-free and interactive user experience. The Arduino board is responsible for processing the voice commands, while the L298N motor driver controls the movement of the car's motors.

# Features

Control the car's movement (forward, backward, left, right) using voice commands.

Interactive and hands-free control system.

Uses Arduino and L298N motor driver for seamless integration.

Easy to set up and customize.

Hardware Requirements

Arduino board

L298N motor driver

DC motors

Bluetooth module

Jumper wires

Power supply

# Installation and Setup

Connect the Arduino board and L298N motor driver as per the provided circuit diagram.

Upload the Arduino code to the board.

Connect the Bluetooth module to establish a wireless connection.

Power on the system and ensure proper functionality.

# Usage
Pair the Bluetooth module with a compatible device (e.g., smartphone, tablet).
Open a Bluetooth terminal application on the device.
Speak the voice commands to control the car's movement (e.g., "forward", "backward", "left", "right").
